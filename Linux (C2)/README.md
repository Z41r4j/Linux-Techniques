### Simple Linux C2

This is a simple Linux C2 where when the agent in installed it will constantly communicate to the Server and responds to certain commands. This is a noisy C2 that does not encrypt its network traffic. Later improvements are to includes AES or HTTPs for encryption and to also create a multi-threaded server, that can handle multiple hosts :)
